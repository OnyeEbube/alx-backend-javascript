# 0x00.ES6 Basics
ECMAScript 2015 was the second major revision to JavaScript.

ECMAScript 2015 is also known as ES6 and ECMAScript 6.

This chapter describes the most important features of ES6.


## Task 0: Const or let?
Modify

- function taskFirst to instantiate variables using const
- function taskNext to instantiate variables using let

## Task 1: Block Scope
Given what you’ve read about var and hoisting, modify the variables inside the function taskBlock so that the variables aren’t overwritten inside the conditional block.

## Task 2: Arrow functions
Rewrite the following standard function to use ES6’s arrow syntax of the function add (it will be an anonymous function after)

## Task 3: Parameter defaults
Condense the internals of the following function to 1 line - without changing the name of each function/variable.
